# 🏆 ResolveHub: Smart Leave & Complaint Management System

An enterprise-grade, role-based workflow application built for seamless management of employee leave requests and grievance resolutions. Designed to satisfy modern Full Stack Engineer (FSE) industry benchmarks (including Cognizant FSE / GenC Next evaluations), technical assessments, and recruitment examinations at top product and service-oriented organizations, this system transitions manual, spreadsheet-based systems into a high-performance, auditable digital portal.

- **Complaint Submission Log**: Simple interface to file issues/grievances directly to HR.
- **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Instant visual feedback on application states (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Resolved) using dynamic status badges.

#### 👩‍💼 HR/Admin Portal (Specialist)
- **HR Analytics Dashboard**: High-level visual widgets tracking active leave pipelines, approved leaves, and open unresolved grievances.
- **AOP System Telemetry**: Live performance diagnostics dashboard fetching real-time execution times of Java services.
- **Approval Engine**: Single-click processing to Approve/Reject leaves or Resolve complaints.
- **Auditable Logs**: Aggregated view of all organizational records.

## ⚡ Advanced Architectural Integrations

### 📊 Aspect-Oriented Programming (Spring AOP Profiling)
To demonstrate advanced system-level engineering, the backend implements Spring AOP to profile and audit service performance.
- **Aspect Execution**: The `PerformanceLoggingAspect` class dynamically intercepts method executions inside the service layer and records execution metrics.
- **Visual Analytics**: Metrics are securely exposed via the REST endpoint `/api/admin/metrics` and visualized inside a dedicated "Spring Boot Runtime Telemetry" card inside the React Admin dashboard.

### 🔀 Asynchronous Concurrency & Multithreading (`@Async`)
To keep backend operations highly responsive, transactional emails are dispatched asynchronously.
- **Thread Pool Config**: Set up a custom `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` pool inside `AsyncConfig` (`core: 3`, `max: 10`, `queue: 100`).
- **Async Execution**: Annotating `EmailService` with `@Async` offloads SMTP processing to background worker threads, freeing HTTP request threads immediately.

### 🛡️ Custom Java Constraints & Validation (JSR-380 Spec)
Rather than relying solely on client validation, strict custom validation constraints are enforced on the Java model:
- **DateRange Constraint**: Created `@ValidDateRange` custom annotation supported by a custom `DateRangeValidator` class.
- **REST Exception Handler**: A global `@RestControllerAdvice` class (`GlobalExceptionHandler`) intercepts validation rejections and returns formatted, field-specific `ErrorResponse` payloads.

## ⚙️ Running Locally

### 🗄️ Database Setup
1. Open your MySQL client (Command Line, Workbench, or phpMyAdmin).
2. The backend is configured to automatically create the database if it doesn't exist via the connection properties: `createDatabaseIfNotExist=true`.
3. Set your MySQL username and password in [application.properties](file:///Users/vedanthonnangi/Desktop/Java/smart-leave-system/backend/src/main/resources/application.properties):
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

### ☕ Running the Backend
From the `backend` directory, start the Spring Boot server using the Maven wrapper:
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The server will boot and run on `http://localhost:8080`.

### ⚛️ Running the Frontend
From the `frontend` directory, install packages and start the Vite development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The development server will launch on `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your browser to experience the application.
